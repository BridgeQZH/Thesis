Part of Abstract: Introduce the latest deep reinforcement learning (RL) based traffic control applications. Specifically, traffic signal control (TSC) applications based on (deep) RL, which have been studied extensively in the literature, are discussed in detail. Different problem formulations, RL parameters, and simulation environments for TSC are discussed comprehensively.   


One problem is that:

When I want to use colab to train the model, I do not know how to edit the ~/.bashrc in order to add the $SUMO_HOME. However, locally some weird error about yellowlight happens.
