# Thesis

This master thesis is about the application of deep reinforcement learning on Intelligent Transport System(ITS). In detail, I will consider the Traffic Signal Control (TSC) problem.

### Current Situation

The cycle length rarely changes as time goes by.

### Why choose deep RL?

RL combined with deep learning, named deep RL, is currently accepted as the state-of-the art learning framework in control systems.

### Challenge

The best approach for optimizing traffic lights is still an open question for researchers, which also proves that the work is meaningful.

### Final product

A system controlling traffic lights with adaptive modules

[1] Deep Reinforcement Learning for Intelligent Transportation Systems: A Survey

Part of Abstract: Introduce the latest deep reinforcement learning (RL) based traffic control applications. Specifically, traffic signal control (TSC) applications based on (deep) RL, which have been studied extensively in the literature, are discussed in detail. Different problem formulations, RL parameters, and simulation environments for TSC are discussed comprehensively.   


### Implementation problems:

1. When trying to use colab to train the model, I do not know how to edit the ~/.bashrc in order to add the $SUMO_HOME. However, locally some tcpip error about yellowlight happens.

### Why authorities want ITS?

Time saving for drivers, energy saving for environment, and safety for all participants.

### Questions(Non-technical):

How to judge the responsibility if accidents happen?
How to prove that autonomous driving will decrease traffic accidents and increase the quality of transportation?

Welcome to discuss in the issues!
